*Note: This file contains only user-facing changes in the 'master' branch.*

  - Added keyboard shortcuts for jumping to menu items, open and focus
    filters, Journal entry types and more. Press <kbd>?</kbd> to display
    an overview of all keyboard shortcuts (Issue #65). (Thanks to redstreet
    for the suggestions)

  - Source editor now supports auto-completion of accounts, commodities, 
    directives and tags.

  - Entries can now be filtered for "No payee" (Issue #42). (Thanks to Jakob
    Schnitzer for the PR)

  - Metadata is now displayed for Journal entries. For transactions, if there 
    is a metadata-entry called "statement" and it's value is a path to a file 
    (relative to the beancount-file or absolute), this file will be liked.

  - Up-to-date indicator will be shown for Assets- and Liabilities-accounts
    in the Statistics view that indicates:
    
        green:  The latest posting is a balance check that passed (known-good)
        red:    The latest posting is a balance check that failed (known-bad)
        yellow: The latest posting is not a balance check (unknown)
        gray:   The account hasn't been updated in a while (as compared to the 
                last available date in the file)

    There are corresponding settings to show the indicator in all other
    views (Balance sheet, etc.), to change the days for the look-back (yellow vs gray) and to exclude certain accounts from displaying the indicator.

  - New settings to show Journal legs by default, to show different entry types
    in a Journal by default, to hide charts by default and to show negative numbers in treemaps

  - Added new command line option "--settings" to specify a settings-file for
    beancount-web, like which entry types to display in a Journal by default.
    There is a sample file called "default-settings.conf" in the source that
    lists all possible settings.

  - Filters are now part of every URL, so every URL is a permalink to the
    view including all currently set filters (Issue #54). (Thanks to Jakob
    Schnitzer for the work on this)

2015-12-22

  - Fixed minor styling issues.

2015-12-21

  - Custom BQL queries (like with `bean-query`) can now be run in a new
    Custom Query view. The results will be displayed as a table and somewhat
    formatted, as account names will be linked to the Account view for example.

2015-12-20

  - Simple tables (Equity/Holdings, Net Worth, Events, Commodities, Options,
    Statistics, Errors) are now sortable by clicking on the column headers
    (Issue #46).

  - Added a yearly balances table to the Account-view. (Thanks to David
    Stephens for the PR)

  - Limited the number of x-axis-labels for bar charts to a maximum of 25
    (Issue #45).

  - Fixed a minor bug where treemaps would show white areas (Issue #49).

  - Fixed daterange filtering of entries. (Thanks to Jakob Schnitzer for the PR)

  - Fixed values in Balance sheet to correctly calculate the closing balances
    (Issue #19).

2015-12-19

  - Added a permalink for the currently set filters, so a user can bookmark
    different filter-settings for quickly applying them (Issue #26).
